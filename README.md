# Treme's Ultimate Game Hub (TUGH)

Welcome to Treme's Ultimate Game Hub!

## Info

- TUGH has been a passion project of mine for a while now!
- I created this website because I dislike the school system's attempt to restrict fun at school.
- Currently, TUGH is in its early stages of development, so expect many updates in the future.

## Planned Updates

- More games are planned to be added in the future. You can request games [here](https://forms.gle/3d3rVWRYnjhApAUf6).
